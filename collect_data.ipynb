Space systems are no exception, They require energy both for propulsion and for other systems like life support, computers, and materials processing. The general field of energy is vast, involving many fields of engineering. Energy for space projects involves an equally wide range. So we can only provide an introduction, and supply references for further study. In this section we survey the range of possible energy sources for all types of space systems. Since the book is oriented to future space projects, we list a number of sources that are not developed yet, but are possible according to known physics. These sources can then be used for the propulsion methods tabulated in Part 2, and for other engineering purposes described in Part 3 and later. By making a two dimensional table of energy sources vs propulsive forces, we can categorize all possible propulsion methods, and we do this at the start of Part 2 of the book. We have not yet developed a similar table to neatly categorize the other systems in a space project. Proximate vs Ultimate Energy',\n",

       "  'answer': \"Engineering applies scientific principles and other forms of knowledge to design, build, and operate systems which perform an intended function. It is a broad discipline, whose parts we will discuss later in Section 1.7 – Engineering Specialties. In a simple project, such as designing a bookcase for home use, a formal engineering process is not needed. One person can calculate the shelf loads and other parameters by themselves, with the help of a calculator and some reference data. Large and complicated projects, however, need the knowledge of multiple specialists, must satisfy multiple desired conditions and functions, and involve large amounts of time and money. A need then exists to coordinate the work, and ensure the final product meets the intended goal, in the most efficient way. Systems Engineering methods have been developed for this coordination task. They have become their own specialty field and are used in addition to the other engineering specialties. Systems Engineering can be used for any type of complex project. However, space systems are usually complicated enough to benefit from it, and systems thinking and methodologies are often used in this field. Given an identified need or desire, how does one select the best design to satisfy it out of the infinite number of possible solutions? For a complex project, the concept of a System has proven useful. A System is defined as a functionally, physically, and/or behaviorally related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements. They are distinguished from the rest of the Universe by a System Boundary (Figure 1.5-1). A system is not a physical entity, but rather a mental construct, created because of it's usefulness, by drawing a line or surface around a collection of elements. The elements have internal relationships to each other and form a comprehensible whole. The rest of the Universe outside the system is referred to as the System Environment, or simply the environment. Flows of many types enter and leave the system as Inputs from and Outputs to the environment by crossing the system boundary . The scope of a given engineering task is then defined by the system boundary, what crosses the boundary, and what is inside. Systems may contain smaller systems within them, which are called Subsystems. These may be nested to any level, but flows into and out of a subsystem must appear in the parent system, or at the top level in the environment. This rule may be called Conservation of Flows – that flows do not appear from or vanish into nothing. Following that rule ensures that all the required inputs and outputs are accounted for.\",\n",

       "  'answer': '← Back to Page 1 Once requirements have been developed to a certain level (see page 1), the next step is Functional Analysis. Engineering analysis in general is the breaking down of an object, system, problem or issue into its basic elements, to get at its essential features and their relationships to each other, and to external elements. Analysis includes developing abstract models or performing calculations for the component elements of a system, to help arrive at a complete and optimized design. Functional analysis is a breakdown on the basis of what a system does, in terms of the functions it performs or a sequence of operations. This is before considering how it is performed. \"How\" is a design solution, which we don\\'t want to choose prematurely. Instead we want to consider all the alternatives and optimizations, which we do in later steps of the process. Prior to selecting the best design, there may be multiple functional breakdowns, at least one for each system concept, and often alternate versions within a concept. The details of these steps and their interactions are recorded in the form of diagrams and models, which can then be used for calculations and assessments.',\n",

       "  'answer': '← Back to Page 1 Once requirements have been developed to a certain level (see page 1), the next step is Functional Analysis. Engineering analysis in general is the breaking down of an object, system, problem or issue into its basic elements, to get at its essential features and their relationships to each other, and to external elements. Analysis includes developing abstract models or performing calculations for the component elements of a system, to help arrive at a complete and optimized design. Functional analysis is a breakdown on the basis of what a system does, in terms of the functions it performs or a sequence of operations. This is before considering how it is performed. \"How\" is a design solution, which we don\\'t want to choose prematurely. Instead we want to consider all the alternatives and optimizations, which we do in later steps of the process. Prior to selecting the best design, there may be multiple functional breakdowns, at least one for each system concept, and often alternate versions within a concept. The details of these steps and their interactions are recorded in the form of diagrams and models, which can then be used for calculations and assessments.',\n",

This is in contrast to the solid surface of the Earth, whose parts are stationary to each other, or moving very slowly.

For completeness, this section includes theoretical transport methods for which: a consensus does not exist, there is no known method to implement it, or even contradicts established physics. They are sorted alphabetically, since there is no reliable way to rank or organize these methods. Although there is not a firm technical basis for these methods, to be listed here, they need at least some theoretical support in the form of published papers or other documentation.

       " {'question': 'What is the scope of a given engineering task defined by the system boundary?',\n",
       "  'answer': \"Engineering applies scientific principles and other forms of knowledge to design, build, and operate systems which perform an intended function. It is a broad discipline, whose parts we will discuss later in Section 1.7 – Engineering Specialties. In a simple project, such as designing a bookcase for home use, a formal engineering process is not needed. One person can calculate the shelf loads and other parameters by themselves, with the help of a calculator and some reference data. Large and complicated projects, however, need the knowledge of multiple specialists, must satisfy multiple desired conditions and functions, and involve large amounts of time and money. A need then exists to coordinate the work, and ensure the final product meets the intended goal, in the most efficient way. Systems Engineering methods have been developed for this coordination task. They have become their own specialty field and are used in addition to the other engineering specialties. Systems Engineering can be used for any type of complex project. However, space systems are usually complicated enough to benefit from it, and systems thinking and methodologies are often used in this field. Given an identified need or desire, how does one select the best design to satisfy it out of the infinite number of possible solutions? For a complex project, the concept of a System has proven useful. A System is defined as a functionally, physically, and/or behaviorally related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements. They are distinguished from the rest of the Universe by a System Boundary (Figure 1.5-1). A system is not a physical entity, but rather a mental construct, created because of it's usefulness, by drawing a line or surface around a collection of elements. The elements have internal relationships to each other and form a comprehensible whole. The rest of the Universe outside the system is referred to as the System Environment, or simply the environment. Flows of many types enter and leave the system as Inputs from and Outputs to the environment by crossing the system boundary . The scope of a given engineering task is then defined by the system boundary, what crosses the boundary, and what is inside. Systems may contain smaller systems within them, which are called Subsystems. These may be nested to any level, but flows into and out of a subsystem must appear in the parent system, or at the top level in the environment. This rule may be called Conservation of Flows – that flows do not appear from or vanish into nothing. Following that rule ensures that all the required inputs and outputs are accounted for.\",\n",

       "  'answer': \"← Back to Page 1 The space projects of the US Department of Defense (DOD), are primarily managed by the United States Air Force (USAF) Space Command, with some assistance from other branches and agencies within the department. It is difficult to get a full view of DOD space-related projects, since it only makes up part of the department's total activity. The 2016 DOD Budget Overview reports $7.1 billion for space investment (page 5-3). The Space Foundation 2015 DoD Space Budget Comparison indicates a total of $9.75 billion, with detailed tables. However, much of the space-related activity is classified, and not included in these totals. Between 2012 and 2013, reported DoD space spending dropped from $27.5 to 10.8 billion, and this difference may represent the classified amount.\",\n",

One of the HE program goals is to expand civilization into more difficult locations, while at the same time improving levels of technology and quality of life. The goal in this study is to establish location parameter ranges for where people live now, and then from that derive what difficult and extreme ranges would be for future locations. We set the middle 90% of where people live now as the existing range for each parameter, with 5% living at each extreme. The middle 90% is described as Temperate, and levels more than 10 and 20% beyond the Temperate range we call Difficult and Extreme respectively. The study will be performed in two parts. The first part will make make initial estimates so that other parts of the HE program design can start to use the information. The second part will survey where people live in more detail and generate improved values. The HE program as a whole is using the start of 2013 as a baseline to reference against. The US Census Bureau projects population at the start of 2013 to be 7,062 million, thus 5% is 353 million. The more detailed population analysis will draw from world statistical data.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'A space systems designer should be aware of existing projects and programs in order to avoid duplication of effort, know the current state of the art, serve as a baseline technical level to improve upon, and as a comparison point to justify the need for new projects. Projects and programs can be categorized by type of funding - government, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors; time - past, current, and proposed future; and by type of project - science and exploration, communications, tourism, mining, etc. There is significant overlap and interaction between the various sectors and projects. For example, government programs procure equipment and services from commercial entities, and contribute funding to not-for-profit programs. Another overlap is that launch vehicle programs provide transportation for different payload projects. Wikipedia has extensive article lists for Spaceflight in general (see also the Category, Portal, and WikiProject links on that page), more specific Lists and Timelines, and categorized Spaceflight Navigation Boxes (used in articles to link to related articles). These can be used to get general background on the various projects and programs. According to the UCS Satellite Database, as of August, 2015, there were an estimated 1305 operational spacecraft in Earth orbit. There are also approximately 20 active Solar System Probes beyond Earth orbit, and 6 spacecraft at Sun-Earth Lagrangian Points. The latter does not include the many natural object at various Lagrangian Points. In addition to active spacecraft, there is a large amount of human-made Space Debris, nearly all in Earth orbit. They can be considered either a hazard or a resource. Finally there are all the natural objects of the Solar System, which can be considered as destinations for exploration, resources to be used, or hazards to be dealt with, such as radiation belts and sources.',\n",

The goals of this stage are to identify the needs to be satisfied, the selection criteria to be used, an initial concept for the major system elements, and how they will be built, operated, maintained, and disposed. The alternatives to building a new system are to do nothing or to continue with existing projects and programs. We therefore assess our system concept against those alternatives and decide whether to go further or to stop. We do this using the selection criteria previously chosen.',\n",

Stars, of course, are a natural supply of photons, but a purpose-made light source of sufficient beam intensity can also be used. Photons, being massless, travel at the maximum possible speed. Thus they are theoretically the highest possible exhaust velocity. By the same token, being massless, they do not transfer much momentum. As noted above, light does not transfer much momentum. So the following methods reach useful thrust level by maximizing area to mass ratio. The large area increases thrust relative to mass. The resulting structure resembles a terrestrial sail.',\n",

They differ in the details of how the incoming air flow and combustion is managed. It should be noted that some vehicle concepts, such as the National Aerospaceplane (NASP) of the 1990's, or the current British Skylon would integrate more than one method in a single engine. This is referred to as a Combined Cycle Engine. The same general engine concepts could be used in a reducing atmosphere, such as Hydrogen or Methane, with Oxygen as the carried fuel, or in a sufficiently powerful nuclear engine with any atmosphere. In the latter case the nuclear engine is used to drive a compressor or heat the incoming gas flow. Fundamental to understanding the operation of air-breathing engines is the concept of mass conservation. The mass of incoming air at the Inlet does not change in total amount going through the engine, although pressure and temperature vary. The exception is the point where fuel is added, or in some types, where condensed air flow is removed. Heat can be added or removed by combustion or heat exchangers, but otherwise the mass flow stays the same. From that constant mass flow, changes in the other conditions of the gas flow can be calculated, and performance derived.\",\n",

In Part 4 we will consider more complex projects and programs, which involve multiple systems. Multiple systems can exist and interact with each other at one time. They can also grow and evolve as a group over an extended time, with new systems replacing older ones. When multiple systems are directed at one or more common goals, we refer to them as a Program, such as the civil space program of the US. An optimized program often results in a design with multiple systems. Reasons for this are described below. For design and management purposes, a large and complex program can be organized into a multi-level structure from the program as a whole, to individually designed systems.

       "  'answer': 'Prior space projects have relied on a Mission concept of operations. That is you plan a mission ahead of time, with a detailed timeline of all the steps you expect to perform. Then the crew and ground controllers execute the plan. If deviations happen, corrective action is taken to return to the plan as much as possible. This concept works for a single mission in isolation with a well defined goal. Future projects will have multiple activities in multiple locations, with larger numbers of people involved and interactions between activities. So planning every step ahead of time in a linear fashion becomes difficult if not impossible. For cost reasons, you also want to reduce the large amount of planning and training that currently goes on relative to the actual doing. For future projects, rather than planning everything in advance, one approach is to develop building blocks of tasks which can then be assembled as needed to reach a goal. As new feedback comes in from other tasks, the building blocks can be adjusted or replaced as needed. Changing plans may not be as efficient as carrying out a fully detailed plan made in advance, but the effort to make those advance plans may be larger than the efficiency loss. The ability to change or replace tasks, rather than a monolithic preplanned mission, also allows continuing operations to adapt and improve over time. This task is the removal of human-made orbital debris, and, if possible, natural hazardous objects. Over time, debris will collide with itself and decay from drag. In the long term it will clean itself up, but in the short term the collisions will generate more hazardous size pieces, which is an unsatisfactory situation. Besides clean up of past debris, this task takes care of cleaning up future defunct, lost, or destroyed hardware. There are a number of methods which have been proposed to do this, none of which have been demonstrated yet:',\n",

       "  'answer': \"An ore is a raw material whose composition is of economic value. On Earth, we generally class as ores those source rocks which are particularly high in one component. In space, the current cost of almost everything is thousands of times higher than on Earth, so almost any kind of mass has economic value. Raw unprocessed rock can be used for radiation shielding, so even that has considerable value. So we consider all NEOs to be ores, but they still have differing compositions which makes them suited for different uses. As noted on Page 1, we don't yet have very good data on the bulk composition and distribution of materials for most Near Earth Objects, but we can make a list of general categories based on observations of the larger main belt asteroids, meteorites, and the small fraction of NEOs with observed spectra. The main categories in the widely used Tholen Asteroid Spectral Types are further subdivided into distinct subtypes. The main types are: These represent 75% of asteroids in general, and an undetermined but probably similar fraction of NEOs. These have a similar composition to the Sun and the original Solar nebula from which the Solar System formed, minus hydrogen, helium, and some volatile compounds. The missing components are gases at the temperature and pressure of NEOs, and so have evaporated away. Unlike the Gas Giant planets, NEOs have no gravity well to speak of to trap these light components. The spectra of these objects are similar to the Carbonaceous Chondrite type meteorites, which are assumed to come from the same source bodies. Specific types within the C-group are enriched or depleted of specific components. Typically they consist of a physical mix of grains of different composition, including a significant iron-nickel component (3–20% depending on subtype), mineral silicates and oxides, sulfides, water (up to 22%), and organic (carbon) compounds from which the group gets its name. C-group objects are very dark, with an albedo (reflectivity in sunlight) of 0.03 to 0.10, so they are hard to spot initially. Initial size estimates tend to underestimate their size, since those are based on average albedos, which are assumed to be 0.10.\",\n",

Although not strictly part of the design process, a large and complex space project also needs an effective Organizational Structure to function. An organization allocates tasks, coordinates the work, makes decisions, supplies the various resources and inputs needed, and provides support to the core design, production, delivery and operations tasks. Individual projects may be part of a larger program or ongoing business, and organizations must then sequence and allocate between them. Economics is the social science that studies production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. Space projects are then an economic activity, and part of a general economy. Large projects need a source of necessary resources, which is often in the form of money. The tools and methods of economics are therefore used to analyze, justify, and obtain the needed money and resources. Organizations and economics are extensively studied at business schools, such as the over 100 courses at MIT's Sloan School of Management, and there are many textbooks on these subjects.\",\n",

Complex space projects require more knowledge and experience than any single individual can have. Such projects need teams of people not only because there is a lot of work to do, but also because each person supplies a different set of skills. For the design portion of a project, the field of engineering is divided into a number of Branches of knowledge, with specialists who concentrate on wider or narrower portions of it. The specialists address different areas of design, and different areas of application to a given project. Much of the actual work for current space projects happens on Earth, in places like offices, factories, launch sites, and control centers. Building and operating those locations uses much of the same engineering knowledge as any other large project on Earth. For the in-space segment of projects, many of the specialties are still relevant. For example, nearly all space hardware has structural parts, and their design is the province of mechanical engineers. In the future, more production and construction will happen in space. This is in contrast to today, where mostly finished hardware is launched from Earth. So the importance of additional fields like mining and industrial engineering will increase, with suitable modifications for operation in space. In the farther future, extremely large projects described as Astrophysical or Planetary Engineering are possible. Examples are Terraforming, making a body more Earth-like, or changing the orbit of a large asteroid. Such very large projects are mostly speculative, except for the human-caused 43% increase in CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. This is anti-terraforming our planet - making it less Earth-like than its original state. Large-scale space projects are one way to correct this problem if it becomes too severe. Very large projects like these are not yet organized as a distinct specialty, but would include knowledge from many areas of science and engineering.\",\n",

Ion and plasma type engines bypass these limits and reach much higher velocities by one or more of: using external energy sources, lower energy density to limit engine heating, or using non-material containment such as magnetic fields to direct the flow. These methods also tend to make ion and plasma engines heavy compared to combustion engines, so they are not used for launch from high gravity bodies. Rather they operate where there is already a low-g environment in orbit or away from gravity wells. The ion and plasma types both involve high energy particles. The distinction is one of density.

Gunpowder-based Guns have a long history. Light-Gas Guns use lower molecular weight gases instead of the explosive products of gunpowder to reach higher velocities. They have been used for high-speed research since about the mid-20th century. Use of such guns for launch to orbit has been proposed several times in the past, but has not yet been put into practice. Therefore they would require R&D work to go from existing research gun experience to versions capable of orbital launch. We refer to this alternative as a Hypersonic Launcher because the gun muzzle velocity is greater than Mach 5, and therefore the projectile flies through the atmosphere at Hypersonic Speeds.

This step adds a much more practical design as a transport hub for getting from one orbit to another quickly and efficiently. Initial construction can use materials from Earth, but in larger sizes or locations beyond Earth orbit using local materials is assumed. The popular concept of a space elevator is based on the original design proposed by Tsiolkovsky in the late 19th century. It involves a single tower/cable extending all the way past Geosynchronous (24 hour) Earth Orbit (GEO). If the center of mass is at GEO and matches the Earth's daily rotation it will appear to hang motionless relative to the ground. Getting to space in theory then becomes an elevator ride. There are several problems with this simplistic design: The Skyhook concept addresses all these problems. Instead of a static cable that stays over a fixed location, it can be either a rotating cable in a moving orbit, much like two spokes of an imaginary wheel rolling around the Equator, or a non-rotating cable in a moving orbit that maintains a vertical orientation relative to the parent body.\",\n",

The large gravity wells around these planets require extra transport systems and energy to navigate. Sunlight is blocked sometimes in closer orbits, at night on surfaces, and always below the surface. Some of the planets and moons have atmospheres and trapped radiation belts, and all the larger ones have significant surface gravity. All of these conditions are different enough from the orbital regions in Phase 4 to need design changes. So we assign development of the larger bodies to a new major phase. The various planets and their surrounding regions are also different from each other, so Phase 5 is divided into five parts. They are in approximate order of difficulty and start times, and tend to start after the respective orbital regions where each body is located. They operate in parallel with all the other phases once started. The first two parts, Phase 5A: Lunar Development and Phase 5B: Mars Development, cover the easiest to reach bodies from Earth. Concepts for these regions are developed enough we devoted two previous sections of this book to them - 4.9 and 4.10. Concepts for the remaining three are less developed and presented below. Phase 5C covers the hot planets Venus and Mercury and their surroundings. 5D covers Jupiter and the varied bodies and difficult environment around it. Lastly, Phase 5E treats the outer three Gas Giants, and the objects and cold environments around them. The Mars region requires slightly more velocity to reach than Venus, but Venus has a much deeper gravity well and no moons. So it is harder to reach anything useful at Venus, and conditions are much worse, so we place it and Mercury after Mars in our sequence.

       "  'answer': 'We begin our review of space transport methods with the structures category. Surviving artificial structures appear as early as 23,000 years ago, in the form of a rough stone wall at the entrance to Theopetra Cave. The wall was probably intended to block cold winds, since that time was near the Last Glacial Maximum. A \"tower whose top is in the heavens\" is famously mentioned in Genesis 9:3, although the baked brick, stone, and tar technology of the first Millennium BC would not have been up to the task. It is only since the late 20th Century that structural materials like Carbon Fiber became available, that are strong enough to perform useful space transport functions. A structure only needs to be built once, but can be used multiple times. The cost per use thus goes down the more often it is used, and the longer the structural life is. This is a very different economic situation than single-use rockets, the main space transport method used to date.',\n",

Numerous fictional works have described the possibilities, with varying amounts of realism. The Library of Congress lists 450 works primarily about Mars as an astronomical object, 73 as an objective of space flight, and numerous other non-fiction works reference it, such as those on planetary science. As of 2017, 25 successful Missions have flown past or arrived at Mars, along with a number of failed attempts. Eight of these are operational, and seven more are in various stages of development. Human missions are a goal for NASA, and colonization is the stated goal of the private company SpaceX. However, most of this attention and work has focused on Mars alone, to the exclusion of the resources and development of the rest of the Solar System. The program we describe in this book is more inclusive. It treats Mars as one place among many to develop. This is partly because other places have different material and energy resources, and their local environments are more suited to some purposes than others. It is also because people are different, and don't all want to live or work in the same kinds of places.\",\n",

It still accounts for the largest segment of artificial mass in orbit, but it is not yet a complete economy. As of 2017 the activities there are mainly public programs, such as scientific and military, and support of activity on the ground, such as Earth observation and some communications. The limited range of activity is a function of the high cost of reaching orbit compared to most activity on the ground. Industrial development on Earth in Phase 2B should greatly reduce transport cost, and exploiting materials and energy already in space should further reduce total costs. The combination should enable larger scale development and a wider economic base in the region. For the purpose of our program we consider Phase 4A to have started once industrial development on Earth (Phase 2B) enabled equipment delivery to orbit. We recognize the existing activities, but consider additions or changes that can be made in the future. New activities in this phase will generally precede other phases in space because Low Orbit is the physically nearest and lowest energy region to reach from Earth. However, most of the useful resources in space are beyond Low Orbit. So a large part of the development in this region will be to support the more distant regions. In turn, the Low Orbit region needs continuing support from Phase 2B industries for space, because industrial-scale production and transport systems are needed to reach low orbit.

We define Recycling as the application of energy and processes to convert materials from a non-useful state back to a useful state. It shares some technology with production from raw materials, except using materials that have already been processed previously and are not in their raw state. In fact some recycling methods will involve feeding waste products back into a production process. A goal for recycling is to achieve Closure, where all waste products are converted back to useful states and the only external input is energy. We expect this to be a theoretical limit similar to conversion efficiency in electrical transformers and motors. Those devices can reach 98% efficiency but not 100%. Similarly, practical recycling is expected to reach a high percentage, but not 100%. To the extent your percent closure CL% approaches 100, the amount of new raw materials required is reduced to 100-CL% of an open system with no recycling. So a high percent closure can have a dramatic effect on the need for new raw material processing or replacement items brought from elsewhere.',\n",

Any propulsion method that expels matter or energy to produce thrust obeys conservation of momentum, which is defined as mass times velocity. The exhaust momentum is equal to and opposite change in vehicle momentum. Given a finite supply of materials for the exhaust, mass is fixed. Therefore higher velocity leads to higher total momentum, and thus better performance for the vehicle. Exhaust velocity is measured in meters/second. Some systems, like 72 Ionospheric Current Engine, do not use exhaust for momentum exchange, but have a consumed supply - plasma generated for contact to the ionosphere in this case.

These types of guns are also called hypervelocity guns since the projectile travels at more than Mach 5 (1500 m/s at sea level). In aerodynamics, velocities above Mach 5 are are called hypersonic. They reach higher velocities by using hot hydrogen (or sometimes helium) as the working gas. These have a lower molecular weight, and therefore a higher speed of sound than the combustion products of smokeless powder, liquid, or gaseous fuels. Guns are strongly limited by the speed of sound of the gas they use, since pressure waves travel at the speed of sound. Therefore any gas at the back of the barrel no longer contributes to pushing a projectile once it reaches the local speed of sound, because the pressure waves cannot keep up. The gases near the projectile and moving at the same speed can still provide pressure, though. So the efficiency of the gun falls significantly, but does not stop entirely as the projectile goes supersonic. Light gases like Hydrogen do not generate high pressures and temperatures by themselves, as do combustion byproducts in standard guns. Therefore some external means are required to produce the hot gas. The various methods are listed in the following sections.',\n",

Performance is always important, and light molecules have higher exhaust velocity at a given temperature. Therefore the tendency is to use Hydrogen if practical since it is the lightest molecule.

       "  'answer': \"The Moon is obvious to anyone who has looked up at the sky. The same reasons for expanding civilization apply to it as to other locations. They include access to new energy and raw material resources for upgrading civilization, and to meet the other objectives listed at the start of Section 4.1. However, we do not start developing the Moon right away for several reasons. First, we must travel through the Low and High Orbit regions to get there, then navigate the Moon's gravity field to reach closer orbits or the surface. This requires more energy and new transport equipment than the orbital regions. Second, the surface has different conditions than the orbital region around it, or the orbital regions around the Earth. So surface equipment also needs new designs. Third, developing the Moon is made easier with support from the previous orbital locations. So we delay the start of Lunar development until after Phases 4A and 4B have been started, and needed (R&D) for this phase is completed in Phase 0M. The Moon's surface is roughly the size of Africa and Australia combined, so it is much too large to be developed all at once. Once started, Phase 5A will continue in parallel with previous phases, with progressive upgrades and expansions over time, both in orbit and on the surface.\",\n",

       " {'question': 'What is the ultimate customer of a smartphone?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'back to page 1 Having set the initial goals we want to achieve, we now want to start developing a design that best meets them, and evaluate how it compares to existing systems. One part of this is turning the vague term \"best\" into an objective measurement method. Complex systems such as these will have many parameters which can be used to compare alternatives. These parameters will have different units of measurement. Since different features of a design, like cost and performance, cannot be directly compared, we convert them to a unified numerical scale, and can then choose whichever option has a higher score on that scale. The conversion formulas represent a mathematical model of what is desirable to the Customer. In other words, it is an objective model of \"best\". This model will evolve through the conceptual design process. At this point we can only start to work on it. The modeling and evaluation is an objective process. The choice of what parameters are to be measured and their relative importance, however, is subjective. It derives from human needs and desires which are not set objectively. In addition, humans often do not know what they would want because they are uninformed on a subject. In our present program, the ultimate customer is civilization as a whole. Most people do not have enough interest or information to know what parameters they would value. Therefore the immediate customer must act as a proxy who expresses their preferences for them. The immediate customers would be the ones in direct contact with the designers. For now that would be contributors to a research foundation, and the program designers themselves. At this stage they cannot educate and poll all of civilization to determine what they would want. Instead they must estimate what they would want if they were well informed and asked their opinion. As an example of this proxy method, the ultimate customers for a smartphone are the people who will eventually use them. Since you don\\'t even know who those people will be, you cannot ask them what their preferences are. Therefore the management, marketing department, and engineering department act as a proxy for those customers and make their best effort to determine what their preferences would be.',\n",

       " {'question': \"What is the HEO region's limit of the Earth's dominant gravitational influence?\",\n",
       "  'answer': 'Our program defines the High Earth Orbit (HEO) region as orbits between 2700 km average altitude and the limit of the Earth\\'s dominant gravitational influence, or Hill Sphere, at 1.5 million km. Where it would not be confused with high orbits around other bodies, we will often shorten the name to \"High Orbit\". Other sources describe this region as Medium Earth Orbit (2,000 to 35,000 km), High Earth Orbit (above 35,000), and Synchronous Orbit as the boundary between them. We are more concerned with the energy to reach the region and the local environment conditions for design purposes. They are similar enough to treat it as one region. Although it covers a large range of distances from Earth, it only represents the upper 25% of energy between the Earth\\'s surface and escape. That\\'s because gravity is an inverse square force and weakens rapidly as you increase distance. All of the region is in vacuum, and most of it is outside the Earth\\'s magnetosphere and exposed to the solar wind. Solar energy levels in the region are also within 2% of that near Earth, so conditions in general are similar across the region.',\n",

       " {'question': 'What is the last major phase of the program?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Phase 6 is the last major phase of our program. The key difference that warrants a new major phase is the extreme distances involved. This mostly breaks the ability for timely delivery to and from the region, and round trip communication with the Solar System is measured in years to decades. Expansion of civilization to these regions would require high self-sufficiency in transport and good enough production systems to enable growth without much assistance. It is far enough in the future that we can only speculate about development in very general terms. We currently divide this major phase into three parts: 6A, 6B, and 6C. The first two cover the interstellar regions between stars to a distance of 20 light-years (LY), and stellar systems, including the regions their gravity dominates, to the same distance. The third covers everything beyond 20 LY, but for now that is mainly a place-holder. This section gathers our early ideas about these three phases, pending further concept exploration work. Interstellar space, the cold regions between stars, is not much different from the environment of the outer parts of the Oort Cloud in Phase 4F. We know very little as yet about equivalent cometary clouds around other stars, or free-floating objects not attached to stars. We have better information about planets and dust disks around other stars. Their parent stars tell us where to look, and the stars themselves provide some data about the planets from Doppler shifts and transits. Disks are visible mainly in the infrared, and are found around younger stars. The number of discovered planets is growing rapidly, from none before 1988 to 3500 confirmed and 4500 candidates by the end of 2017. We expect there are also many smaller objects in systems with planets, but today we can only infer them indirectly.',\n",

For now we will gather our early ideas about these program phases here in one place, pending further concept exploration work. The earlier parts of Phase 4 cover developing the Low Orbit (Phase 4A) and High Orbit (Phase 4B) regions around the Earth, and the Inner Interplanetary region (Phase 4C) around the Sun to a distance of 1.8 AU. They were described previously in sections 4.5 to 4.7 of this book. Those three regions are the closest and easiest to reach from Earth, so we expect them to start development first. The remaining three orbital regions cover successively farther regions from the Sun: Phase 4D - Main Belt and Trojan, Phase 4E - Outer Interplanetary, and Phase 4F - Scattered, Hills, and Oort. These are farther in the future, so our concepts are less developed for them.',\n",
