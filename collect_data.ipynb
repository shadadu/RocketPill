Space systems are no exception, They require energy both for propulsion and for other systems like life support, computers, and materials processing. The general field of energy is vast, involving many fields of engineering. Energy for space projects involves an equally wide range. So we can only provide an introduction, and supply references for further study. In this section we survey the range of possible energy sources for all types of space systems. Since the book is oriented to future space projects, we list a number of sources that are not developed yet, but are possible according to known physics. These sources can then be used for the propulsion methods tabulated in Part 2, and for other engineering purposes described in Part 3 and later. By making a two dimensional table of energy sources vs propulsive forces, we can categorize all possible propulsion methods, and we do this at the start of Part 2 of the book. We have not yet developed a similar table to neatly categorize the other systems in a space project. Proximate vs Ultimate Energy',\n",

       "  'answer': \"Engineering applies scientific principles and other forms of knowledge to design, build, and operate systems which perform an intended function. It is a broad discipline, whose parts we will discuss later in Section 1.7 – Engineering Specialties. In a simple project, such as designing a bookcase for home use, a formal engineering process is not needed. One person can calculate the shelf loads and other parameters by themselves, with the help of a calculator and some reference data. Large and complicated projects, however, need the knowledge of multiple specialists, must satisfy multiple desired conditions and functions, and involve large amounts of time and money. A need then exists to coordinate the work, and ensure the final product meets the intended goal, in the most efficient way. Systems Engineering methods have been developed for this coordination task. They have become their own specialty field and are used in addition to the other engineering specialties. Systems Engineering can be used for any type of complex project. However, space systems are usually complicated enough to benefit from it, and systems thinking and methodologies are often used in this field. Given an identified need or desire, how does one select the best design to satisfy it out of the infinite number of possible solutions? For a complex project, the concept of a System has proven useful. A System is defined as a functionally, physically, and/or behaviorally related group of regularly interacting or interdependent elements. They are distinguished from the rest of the Universe by a System Boundary (Figure 1.5-1). A system is not a physical entity, but rather a mental construct, created because of it's usefulness, by drawing a line or surface around a collection of elements. The elements have internal relationships to each other and form a comprehensible whole. The rest of the Universe outside the system is referred to as the System Environment, or simply the environment. Flows of many types enter and leave the system as Inputs from and Outputs to the environment by crossing the system boundary . The scope of a given engineering task is then defined by the system boundary, what crosses the boundary, and what is inside. Systems may contain smaller systems within them, which are called Subsystems. These may be nested to any level, but flows into and out of a subsystem must appear in the parent system, or at the top level in the environment. This rule may be called Conservation of Flows – that flows do not appear from or vanish into nothing. Following that rule ensures that all the required inputs and outputs are accounted for.\",\n",

       " {'question': 'What is the first step in Functional Analysis?',\n",
       "  'answer': '← Back to Page 1 Once requirements have been developed to a certain level (see page 1), the next step is Functional Analysis. Engineering analysis in general is the breaking down of an object, system, problem or issue into its basic elements, to get at its essential features and their relationships to each other, and to external elements. Analysis includes developing abstract models or performing calculations for the component elements of a system, to help arrive at a complete and optimized design. Functional analysis is a breakdown on the basis of what a system does, in terms of the functions it performs or a sequence of operations. This is before considering how it is performed. \"How\" is a design solution, which we don\\'t want to choose prematurely. Instead we want to consider all the alternatives and optimizations, which we do in later steps of the process. Prior to selecting the best design, there may be multiple functional breakdowns, at least one for each system concept, and often alternate versions within a concept. The details of these steps and their interactions are recorded in the form of diagrams and models, which can then be used for calculations and assessments.',\n",
